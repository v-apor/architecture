Object-oriented analysis (OOA):
It is the process of looking at a problem, system, or task
(that somebody wants to turn into an application) and identifying the objects and
interactions between those objects. The analysis stage is all about what needs to be done.

Object-oriented design (OOD):
It is the process of converting such requirements into an
implementation specification. The designer must name the objects, define the behaviors,
and formally specify which objects can activate specific behaviors on other objects. The
design stage is all about how things should be done.

Object-oriented programming (OOP):
It is the process of converting this perfectly-defined
design (from OOD) into a working program.

Object: 
Objects are instances of classes that can be associated with each other. 
An object instance is a specific object with its own set of data and behaviors.
    Data: Data represents the individual characteristics of a certain object
    Behavior: Behaviors are actions that can occur on an object. 
    The behaviors that can be performed on a specific class of object are called methods.
